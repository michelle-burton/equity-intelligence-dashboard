# 🧠 Equity Intelligence Dashboard

AI-powered equity snapshot system that captures structured stock data, stores historical snapshots, compares deltas over time, and generates narrative summaries from public market data.

Built for long-term investors focused on pattern recognition, disciplined analysis, and repeatable intelligence — not day trading.

## 🎯 Why This Exists

Retail investors have access to endless data but very little structured interpretation.

This project turns raw public market data into:

- 📸 Repeatable snapshots  
- 🗂 Historical memory  
- 📊 Momentum pattern tracking  
- ✍️ AI-generated thesis summaries  
- 🔄 Delta-based intelligence  

The goal is not prediction.  
The goal is structured clarity.

## ⚙️ Core Concept

Twice a month (or on demand), the system:

1. Captures a structured equity snapshot  
2. Stores it as a historical record  
3. Compares it against prior snapshots  
4. Generates an AI summary explaining what changed  

Over time, this builds a longitudinal intelligence layer.
